I created a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. It follows a standard deep-learning workflow for image classification tasks. 

Let's break down the code and discuss the algorithm used:

Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing necessary libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, and other utilities for handling data and visualization.

Constants and Setup:

image_size: Defines the target size for input images.
batch_size: Specifies the batch size for training.
epochs: Indicates the number of training epochs.
num_classes: Defines the number of classes in the classification task (in this case, 2 for violence and non-violence).
The code also mounts Google Drive for accessing data from Google Drive.
Downloading and Unzipping Data:

The code uses gdown to download a dataset from Google Drive using a file ID.
The downloaded ZIP file is then unzipped to access the dataset.
Data Preparation:

File paths for CSV files containing data annotations (train, test, and valid) are constructed.
The CSV files are read into Pandas DataFrames for further processing.
An ImageDataGenerator is created for data augmentation, which is used during training to create variations of the input images to improve model generalization.
Data Generators:

Data generators are created for training, validation, and testing. These generators yield batches of images and their corresponding labels during training.
flow_from_dataframe is used to generate data from Pandas DataFrames.
Model Architecture:

A pre-trained ResNet-50 model is loaded from Keras's applications with weights pre-trained on ImageNet. This model serves as a feature extractor.
A global average pooling layer is added to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
A fully connected layer with 1024 units and ReLU activation is added for feature transformation.
Finally, a softmax layer with the number of output classes (2 in this case) is added for classification.
Model Compilation:

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, which is common for multiclass classification tasks.
Accuracy is chosen as the evaluation metric.
Model Training:

The model is trained using the fit method, with training and validation data generators.
Training history is stored, including loss and accuracy values for each epoch.
Model Evaluation:

The trained model is evaluated on the test data, and test accuracy is printed.
Visualization:

Training history (loss and accuracy) is plotted using Matplotlib to visualize the training progress.
