Using TensorFlow and Keras, we built and trained a hybrid deep-learning model for a multiclass image classification task. This code specifically targets a "Violence Detection" dataset, which seems to contain images related to violence/non-violence scenarios. Let's break down the code and discuss the algorithm used:

Data Preprocessing:

The code starts by unzipping a dataset stored in a ZIP file named "Violence Detection.v1-v1.multiclass.zip."
Three CSV files are loaded: one each for training, validation, and testing data. These CSV files likely contain image filenames and corresponding class labels.
Image data is preprocessed by loading each image, resizing it to a target size of (224, 224), converting it to a NumPy array, and applying preprocessing suitable for the ResNet-50 model using preprocess_input.
Loading Pre-trained ResNet-50 Model:

The code loads a pre-trained ResNet-50 model from Keras's applications. The model is configured to exclude the top classification layer and accept input images of shape (224, 224, 3).
Building the Classification Head:

A custom classification head is added on top of the ResNet-50 base model.
The output of the ResNet-50 base is flattened.
A dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation is added.
The final output layer consists of a dense layer with a softmax activation function. The number of units in this layer is equal to the number of classes, which is 2 in this case (nonViolence and Violence).
Creating the Hybrid Model:

The Model class is used to create the hybrid model, taking the image input and producing the classification output.
Compiling the Model:

The model is compiled with the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. The metric used for evaluation is accuracy.
Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets using train_test_split. The training set contains 80% of the data, while the validation and test sets each contain 10%.
Model Training:

The model is trained using the training data. The batch size and number of epochs are specified.
Training progress is monitored on the validation data.
Model Evaluation:

After training, the model is evaluated on the test set, and the test accuracy is printed.
