ResNet-50 on Binary Class Dataset:

☻ Accuracy: 60.77%
☻ Description: ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network architecture that is based on the residual network architecture. Residual networks address the problem of vanishing gradients by adding shortcut connections between layers. This allows the network to learn deeper features and improve its accuracy. ResNet-50 has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of image recognition tasks, including object detection.
☻ Strengths: ResNet-50 is known for its ability to train very deep networks effectively, making it suitable for complex tasks. It has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various image classification benchmarks.
☻ Limitations: A binary classification accuracy of 60.77% may suggest that the model is struggling to learn the features specific to violence detection. Fine-tuning or using a more suitable architecture may be necessary.

ResNet-50 on Multi-Label Class Dataset:

☻ Accuracy: 48.72%
☻ Description: ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network architecture that is based on the residual network architecture.
